# Lab-Report-Classification

Lab reports often contain a wealth of scientific or technical information encompassing experiments, observations, and detailed analyses, presented in various formats such as textual descriptions and numerical data. Automating the classification process of the lab reports helps in addressing the challenges researchers often encounter when dealing with vast amounts of unstructured data. The time-consuming manual effort required to organize and categorize these reports can be significantly high. 

The goal of this project is to develop a multi-class classification model using Python that can automatically categorize lab reports into predefined classes based on their content. Through the utilization of machine learning techniques, our aim is to develop a classification model that can accurately and efficiently classify lab reports, streamlining the organization. 

Ultimately, the successful development of this multi-class classification model will significantly contribute to the scientific community, empowering researchers and organizations to efficiently manage and access critical lab report data, facilitating a more streamlined and data-driven approach to scientific research and decision-making.

The following are the objectives of this project: 
1. Save time and effort for researchers by automating the classification process: By developing a machine learning model that can automatically classify lab reports, this project aims to streamline the process and free up researchers' time for more critical tasks, such as productivity, enabling researchers to allocate more time and focus on critical analysis and drawing conclusions from the research.
2. Develop a program that allows users to upload lab reports and receive their classifications promptly: To make the lab report classification accessible and 
convenient for researchers, this project aims to create a model using Python. Researchers can simply upload their lab reports to the model, and the model will automatically classify them into appropriate categories. The prompt delivery of classifications enhances the user experience and encourages more researchers to use the system.
